# readme-generator
a javascript application that helps its user create a professional read me file.

## Description

This javascript file will help users create a professional read me file by using the inquirer packet to ask its user a series of questions relating to the project. It will ask for the project name, Installation requestions, how to use it licensings information as well as contributing and testing specifics. The application will also ask the users for their github and email to append contact information. After all questions are answer it will then generate the README file and put it in the generated folder.

What I learned from this project is the usage of the inquirer and fs to create/write files. I also learned how to require another js file to export a method into my index.js file so I can use it there. I learned to use inquirer to ask the user a series of questions and giving the users the ability to input text into console and saving the input. I also learned to create files by using fs in the library.

## Usage

- After install inquirer. Run node index.js
